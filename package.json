  "description": "This is a study project for learning who to build a SPA with React and Node. I intend to simplify (not build) some features that would make sense to develop in case the goal was to make a product. I will develop user registration, loggin, creation on a conversation and a simple chat. If you would like to see how I'm doing it or did it feel free to clone/fork. It won't be manteined later since it's not meant to be used. Thank you for reading this! Bye!",
